How the hell did you find me in this universe?
A billion different people, still I found you first
Look what you done - you just crashed in, you changed my whole life
Found a way to my heart now it's like you've been here the whole time
Cause girl you make it oh so easy
Oh, so easy to love you
Cause girl you make it oh so easy
Oh, so easy to love you
I'm not smart enough to try to understand
Why you chose my love over a better man
Look what you've done - you've just crashed in, you've changed my whole life
Found a way to my heart now it's like you've been the whole time
Cause girl you make it oh so easy
Oh, so easy to love you
Cause girl you make it oh so easy
Oh, so easy to love you
Oh, my heart's jumping out of my chest
I keep falling again and again
Cause girl you make it oh so easy
Oh, so easy to love you
Look what you done - you just crashed in, you changed my whole life
Found a way to my heart now it's like you've been here the whole time
Cause you girl make it oh so easy
Oh, so easy to love you
Cause girl you make it oh so easy
Oh, so easy to love you
Oh, my heart's jumping out of my chest
I keep falling again and again
Cause girl you make it oh so easy
Oh, so easy to love you
Make it so easy
So easy to love you
